                <p class="card-text">
                The Industry 4.0 readiness for <em>Condition Based Maintenance</em> (CBM) is an evidence-based process to assure that an asset can use and integrate Industry 4.0 into its condition-based maintenance strategy. It is designed to provide substantial evidence to the deployment owner for confidence in the project and the organizationâ€™s maintenance system.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-dark"><small style="color:#C92049">The Concept</small></h2>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li>The online self-assessment is broken down into 5 key dimensions  and 25 sub dimensions  with some focus on the technology dimensions which bothers more on 7 components modules of condition-based maintenance. Each key dimension contains questions and indicators on different areas or subdimensions. Below are the 5 core dimensions and questions pointing inth direction of the readiness check.
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>Organization:</strong> To what extent is Industry 4.0 established and implemented in your company's CBM strategy?</li>
                      <li><strong>Technology/IT Solutions:</strong> To what extent do you utilise industry 4.0 technologies for data-driven services, diagnosis, prognosis and decision-making for improved equipment reliability</li>
                      <li><strong>Processes, Operations and Maintenance:</strong> To what extent are the CBM-related processes including the operations and maintenance activities digitally integrated, modelled and capable of being managed using industry 4.0 technologies?</li>
                      <li><strong>People:</strong> Does your organisation have the required skills to implement and integrate Industry 4.0 technologies in the condition-based maintenance strategy?</li>
                      <li><strong>Sustainability(Environment):</strong> To what extent are you using Industry 4.0 technologies to make improvements your CBM performance and productivity without compromising the environment?</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-dark"><small style="color:#C92049">Guidance for Using the I4.0 Assessment Tool</small></h2>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li>During the online assessment, you will be guided through a series of questions related to your implementation of Industry 4.0 in <em>Condition Based Maintenance</em>. It is estimated that completing the Online Self-Check will require approximately 15 minutes of your time.
                    <ol type="A">
                      <li><strong>Dimensions of Assessment:</strong> The tool includes questions and indicators across five different dimensions: people, organization, i4.0 solutions, process, operations and maintenance, and sustainability. Users must read and score each indicator following every question.</li>
                      <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong>  Each indicator associated with a question is scored from "0" to "4," with "0" indicating the lowest level of readiness or maturity.</li>
                      <li><strong>Frequency of Assessment:</strong> The frequency of assessment usage is at the discretion of the facility manager, or an equivalent position as specified by the organization. This is particularly important when there's a need to determine the level of I4.0 implementation in CBM and to access recommendations for improvement.</li>
                      <li><strong>Outcome of Assessment:</strong> Upon completion of the assessment, the tool calculates the overall maturity or readiness level and the level for each dimension. It then provides recommendations to help the organization progress further to the next level.</li>
                      <li><strong>Terminology:</strong> The terms <strong><em>Industry 4.0 (I4.0)</em></strong> and <strong><em>Condition Based Maintenance (CBM)</em></strong> are frequently used in their abbreviated forms throughout the assessment.</li>
                    </ol>
